Welcome to Lumache's documentation!
===================================

The **ustat_var** package contains the non-parametric unbiased estimators of the variance of teacher effects described in `Rose, Schellenberg, and Shem-Tov (2022) <https://www.nber.org/papers/w30274>`. 
These unbiased estimators are U-statistics, which provide minimum-variance unbiased estimators of population parameters for arbitrary probability distributions. 
The U -statistic approach overcomes several issues experienced by Empirical Bayes (EB) techniques when estimating an agent's 'value-added'.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
